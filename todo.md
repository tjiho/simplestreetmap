# Code organisation

 **TODO: Keep Place.js and Search.js in class ?**

 What about just functions (as linter says "Do not use 'new' for side effects.") ?

 If they are functions, are they tools ?

 **TODO: Find a css linter**


# Features

 **TODO: Itinerary**

 **TODO: Display bus lines**

 **TODO: Share/save/export data**

 - With a gpx file ?
 - With a custom json file ?
 - With a backend ? random id like etherpad
 - In the Url ?
 - In the localStorage ? But it's not shareable and it's not persistent in the long-term
